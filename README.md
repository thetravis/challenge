# challenge
An example of a product catalog with web user interface (HTML + JS) running on a Python Flask server using MySQL database.

Installation:

Start with installing MySQL server

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Then see mysql_setup.txt to create the database (this will be automated later when I've had enough coffee) 

Then run (in Debian-like OS 'sudo' may be needed)

sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install -r requirements.txt 

python server.py

and open your browser with address: 127.0.0.1:5000
